# Code Conventions

Shared conventions for all tskovlund repositories. Each repo includes the
relevant subset in its own AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md / CONTRIBUTING.md.

## Code Quality

- **Proper fixes over workarounds.** Solve at the root cause. If a hack is
  unavoidable (something outside our control), track it so it can be replaced
  when a proper solution is available
- **No magic constants** — named constants for ports, protocol versions, error
  codes. Every literal value must be self-documenting
- **No DRY violations** — extract shared logic into a single source of truth.
  Prefer a base class or utility over copy-paste
- **Single responsibility** — each file and class has one clear purpose
- **Full variable names** — `measure_index` not `m`, `connection` not `conn`.
  Intent should be readable, not inferred from abbreviations
- **No shorthand** — `exception` not `exc`, `message` not `msg`, `response`
  not `resp`
- **Idempotency** — scripts, migrations, and deployments must be safe to run
  twice

## Dependencies & Security

- **Lockfiles always committed** — `uv.lock`, `package-lock.json`,
  `flake.lock`, etc. Reproducible builds
- **No secrets in code** — env vars or secret managers. `.env` files gitignored

## Git & Workflow

- **Conventional commits** — `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, `test:`,
  `chore:`
- **Direct to main** for small changes, **branch + PR** for structural work
- **PR review loop** before merge on structural changes

## Project Structure

- **Follow established conventions per language/framework** — standard
  framework structures
- **AGENTS.md in every repo** with a CLAUDE.md symlink — the canonical file for
  AI agent instructions
- **Shared CI via `tskovlund/.github`** — reusable workflows for common
  patterns. Repos reference shared workflows instead of duplicating CI
  configuration
- **Automate enforcement** — CI checks, pre-commit/pre-push hooks, linting,
  and type checking should enforce every rule that can be checked automatically
- **Conventions belong in the repo** — each repo includes the relevant subset
  of these conventions in its own docs. Redundancy across repos is intentional
  so that every contributor picks them up
